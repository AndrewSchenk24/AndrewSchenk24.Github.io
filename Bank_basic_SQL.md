Outline:
	Since 1947, The World Bank has funded over 12,000 development projects, via low interest loans and grants. Many of these projects involve developing infrastructure, education, and social programs in developing countries. The World Bank serves as a vital resource for many countries for both financial and technical support for long term development and in response to critical events such as recovery from natural disasters. 
The Data for this project was collected directly from the World bank from the most recent snapshot of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) statement of loans. This most recent snapshot reflects the standing of all current IBRD loans as of January 16, 2024. This dataset can be found on the World Bank’s website if you’re interested in taking a look. 
In this scenario I have been tasked by The World Bank to give an update on current lending. The World Bank has specifically requested information regarding the following questions:
-How many countries are receiving assistance through the IBRD through how many projects?
-Breakdown of the Num of projects and loans by country.
-how much money is currently owed to IBRD by all countries?
-What is the average service charge (for loans that are still in repayment)
-Provide a list of the 10 countries that owe the most
-The country, project name, and amount due of the highest amount due to get a feel for what the most highly financed projects are.

RESULTS:
1.	The World Bank is currently serving 127 countries funding 7450 different projects
2.
