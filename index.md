### My Data Story
As a former physical therapist and Realtor, I have extensive experience providing solutions to customers and stakeholders of all backgrounds. I take pride in my analytical mindset and passion for problem-solving and data-based decision making. Now, I am eager to pursue my passion for data analysis and apply my skills to transition to a data role. I specialize in data visualization, data cleaning, and data modeling. I am proficient in Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I am a great team player and have excellent communication skills. I hope you enjoy exploring my data portfolio and please reach out with any questions!
