# Welcome to My Data Portfolio


### My Data Story
As a physical therapist and Realtor, I have extensive experience providing solutions to customers and stakeholders of all backgrounds. I take pride in my analytical mindset and passion for problem-solving and data-based decision making. I am eager to pursue my passion for data analysis and apply my skills to transition to a data role. I am proficient in Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I have extensive experience collaborating with cross-functional teams to acheive outcomes. I have a passion for learning. If I'm not working on improving technical and analytical skills I am likely studying Spanish and Mandarin Chinese or not getting that much better at chess! I hope you enjoy exploring my data portfolio and please reach out with any questions.
